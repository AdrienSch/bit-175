    <p class="center">Fall Guys is a massive multiplayer battle royale party game. The basic premise of <br>
    the game is to battle your way through all of the party games just to get to the final <br>
    round to face off against the finalists for a chance to win that epic victory royale!

    <p class="center">Well for starters, you can either play by yourself or in a group. <br>
    You can choose to either play the normal game or play in a custom match with others. <br>
    Other than playing the game to win, you can have fun with other players, emote with <br>
    others, and customize your character with any available cosmetic that you have too.</p>
