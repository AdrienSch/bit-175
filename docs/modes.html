    <h2>Modes</h2>
    <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-6 col-sm-12"><p class="lead">In Fall Guys, there is more than one type of mode to play.
    Either you'll be against everybody or you'll be on a team versus another team. 
    In this game, you'll face off against your opponents in <strong class="strong">Races</strong>, 
    <strong class="strong">Hunts</strong>, <strong class="strong">Survival</strong>, <strong class="strong">Puzzles</strong>, <strong class="strong">Team vs. Team</strong>,
    and <strong class="strong">Finals</strong>.</p></div>

    <h3 class="left">Races</h3>
    <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-6 col-sm-12"><p class="left">In this mode, you're tasked with going from point "A" to point "B." 
    As you're trying to race to the finish, you must also navigate and get past certain 
    obstacles blocking your path towards the finish line. Be sure to note that 
    you need to get to the finish line before the timer hits 5 minutes and before you 
    reach the cutoff point of how many people are able to qualify the stage.</p></div>

    <h3 class="left">Survival</h3>
    <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-6 col-sm-12"><p class="left">In this mode, you're tasked with staying alive and not getting
    eliminated! A few tips that might help your survivability in these rounds is to 
    scope out what everybody else is doing and see if you need to acclimate yourself 
    to that standard. Always be on the vigil just in case somebody's going to try and 
    get rid of you too. Most importantly, don't do any of the crazy stuff, let 
    everyone else do that stuff first so you can get an idea whether or not that'd be a 
    good idea.</p></div>

    <h3 class="left">Hunt</h3>
    <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-6 col-sm-12"><p class="left">In this mode, it's all about ruining your opponent's chances to 
    proceed to the next stage. If you're playing a level like "Tail Tag," don't be 
    predictable. Just wait it out and when the opponent is nearby and unaware of your 
    presence, swoop in and grab that tail, preferably in the last 30 seconds before the 
    match ends. Unpredictability and experience will triumph most opponents in this type of mode.</p></div>

    <h3 class="left">Puzzles</h3>
    <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-6 col-sm-12"><p class="left">In this mode, it's mostly about being able to figure out the logic 
    of the level and going from point "A" to point "B" most of the time, too. One sure way 
    of being able to qualify and not get left behind is to try and find the opponent 
    that knows what they're doing and tail them from behind, that way you're picking up 
    on what they're doing in the process.</p></div>

    <h3 class="left">Team</h3>
    <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-6 col-sm-12"><p class="left">In this mode, you play on a team of players versus another team of players. 
    Whether it be basketball or soccer, the goal remains the same, score more than the 
    other team so that you and your team can qualify to the next round!</p></div>

    <h3 class="left">Finals</h3>
    <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-6 col-sm-12"><p class="left">Congratulations! You made it to the pinnacle of all the rounds. 
    Now you'll be fighting against your fellow competitors for a chance at getting that victory royale. 
    To do well here, play smart and keep an eye on the experienced players as they are 
    the most dangerous of competitors in the final round. If you need to do a gutsy play to 
    secure the win, go right ahead. In the end, trying is what matters most!</p></div>
