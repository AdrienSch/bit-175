    <h2 class="center">Modes</h2>
    <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-6 col-sm-12"><p class="lead">In Fall Guys, there is more than one type of mode to play.
    Either you'll be against everybody or you'll be on a team versus another team. 
    In this game, you'll face off against your opponents in <strong class="strong">Races</strong>, 
    <strong class="strong">Hunts</strong>, <strong class="strong">Survival</strong>, <strong class="strong">Puzzles</strong>, <strong class="strong">Team vs. Team</strong>,
    and <strong class="strong">Finals</strong>.</p></div>

    <h3 class="left">Races</h3>
    <p class="left">In this mode, you're tasked with going from point "A" to point "B." <br>
    As you're trying to race to the finish, you must also navigate and get past certain <br>
    obstacles blocking your path towards the finish line. Be sure to note that <br>
    you need to get to the finish line before the timer hits 5 minutes and before you <br>
    reach the cutoff point of how many people are able to qualify the stage.</p>

    <h3 class="left">Survival</h3>
    <p class="left">In this mode, you're tasked with staying alive and not getting <br>
    eliminated! A few tips that might help your survivability in these rounds is to <br>
    scope out what everybody else is doing and see if you need to acclimate yourself <br>
    to that standard. Always be on the vigil just in case somebody's going to try and <br>
    get rid of you too. Most importantly, don't do any of the crazy stuff, let <br>
    everyone else do that stuff first so you can get an idea whether or not that'd be a <br>
    good idea.</p>

    <h3 class="left">Hunt</h3>
    <p class="left">In this mode, it's all about ruining your opponent's chances to <br>
    proceed to the next stage. If you're playing a level like "Tail Tag," don't be <br>
    predictable. Just wait it out and when the opponent is nearby and unaware of your <br>
    presence, swoop in and grab that tail, preferably in the last 30 seconds before the <br>
    match ends. Unpredictability and experience will triumph most opponents in this type of mode.</p>

    <h3 class="left">Puzzles</h3>
    <p class="left">In this mode, it's mostly about being able to figure out the logic <br>
    of the level and going from point "A" to point "B" most of the time, too. One sure way <br>
    of being able to qualify and not get left behind is to try and find the opponent <br>
    that knows what they're doing and tail them from behind, that way you're picking up <br>
    on what they're doing in the process.</p>

    <h3 class="left">Team</h3>
    <p class="left">In this mode, you play on a team of players versus another team of players. <br>
    Whether it be basketball or soccer, the goal remains the same, score more than the <br>
    other team so that you and your team can qualify to the next round!</p>

    <h3 class="left">Finals</h3>
    <p class="left">Congratulations! You made it to the pinnacle of all the rounds. <br>
    Now you'll be fighting against your fellow competitors for a chance at getting that victory royale. <br>
    To do well here, play smart and keep an eye on the experienced players as they are <br>
    the most dangerous of competitors in the final round. If you need to do a gutsy play to <br>
    secure the win, go right ahead. In the end, trying is what matters most!</p>
