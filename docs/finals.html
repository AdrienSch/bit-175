    <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-6 col-sm-12"><p class="left">You and however many players are left must survive by staying at the 
    top of all the hexagonal layers. Your goal is to outlast all your opponents, and if necessary, 
    cut off your opponents' pathways or try to find a way to eliminate them so you can secure a victory!</p></div>

    <h3 class="left">Hex-A-Ring</h3>
    <div class="container">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="Hexaring.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-6 col-sm-12"><p class="left">You and however many players are left must survive by running across a rolling
        wheel of hexagonal platforms stuck together. The wheel pushes against you as you run against it, with each hexagonal platform disappearing after you step on it.
        The objective is to be the last one running and staying alive as your opponents run out of tiles to stand on, therefore falling into the pit of slime down beneath!

    <h3 class="left">Hex-A-Terrestrial</h3>
    <div class="container">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="Hexaterrestrial.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-6 col-sm-12"><p class="left">In this final, the objective is similar to that of "Hex-A-Gon." But instead of multiple layers of hexagonal tiles, there's only
        one layer, so you gotta be real vigilant in order to stay alive! At some point, the boundaries of the map will close in on you, to prevent yourself from falling into the abyss,
        move closer to the inner-hexagonal tiles so that the map boundaries don't eliminate the floor underneath your character. An important thing to note about this level is 
        that the hexagonal tiles will reappear after a short duration of time passes after yourself or somebody else has made them disappear.
